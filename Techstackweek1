Java Techstack.

Java is one of the most popular techstacks and its simpler than some of the other techstacks that are used today in wider society.
It if often refered to Java full stack as obviously the java part is the programming languages and the full stack term refers to the entire computer system; frontend and backend.
These are named front and back as almost colloquial as its what the user will and won't see.
The frontend of the techstack has one of the most popular coding languages that are used worldwide, javascript. 
It can be confusing however for people early in the knowledge of java as java and java full stack are actually different things. 
For example, java by itself is just a popular coding language however the full stack is the whole web technology.
